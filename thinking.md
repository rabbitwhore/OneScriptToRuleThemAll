## Ideas

This is for new ideas and features


### Features
- I want to download a git project to a specific folder
- I want to fix so [`CloneProject`](/app//git/cloneHandler.py) uses the path inside .env


### Fixed features
- ~~Create a git commit and git push command, and it will work in the current folder im using  it~~ &check;
- ~~Fix so if so i can use this script inside any folder with an alias and it will always now in what folder i run the command~~ &check;
- ~~When i init a dev/prod state its creates two different folders~~ &check;
- ~~Fix so it can run with arguments and have control panel, like typing "clone" and "init project" will create a folder structure for dev/prod~~ &check;
- ~~Fix a tutorial for setting up alias on windows~~ &check;

### ideas

~~The script will have git functions and a combined git function for add, commit and push.~~

The script will handle dev and prod state, and copy files from dev to prod, it will also copy files from prod to an archive folder where everything is zipped with a date.
